My current research is primarily for my dissertation, which is centered on Arctic sea ice data. Two other formative projects are included as well.

## Arctic Ice Sheet Movement Tracking

- My first project concentrates on using Bayesian nonparametric methods for clustering spatial, functiona data in order to track movement of ice sheets in the Beaufort Sea.

## Variable Correlation in Logistic Regression
- I worked as a research assistant during my Master's program at South Dakota State University, with funding generously provided by CAPITAL Services of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
- The research itself was investigating correlation reduction and the variance inflation factor between two credit scoring systems that are both essential in a model.

## Honeybee Population Dynamics
- My primary task was modeling honeybee populations via a system of differential equations where the impact of the *varroa destructor* mite was of key importance.
- This was my undergraduate Honors Thesis research and one of my first forays into research.
