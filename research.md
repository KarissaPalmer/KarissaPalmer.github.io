My current research is primarily for my dissertation, developing spatial methods for Arctic Sea Ice data. I am advised by [Dr. Yawen Guan](https://yawenguan.github.io). Two other formative projects are included as well.

## Arctic Ice Sheet Movement Tracking
- My first project concentrates on using Bayesian semiparametric methods for clustering spatial functional data in order to track movement of ice sheets in the Beaufort Sea.

## Variable Correlation in Logistic Regression
- I worked as a research assistant during my Master's program at South Dakota State University, as a fellow for [CAPITAL Card Services](https://capitalsvcs.com) in Sioux Falls, SD.
- We investigated multicollinearity and teh variance inflation factor in a logistic regression model, with applications to credit scoring systems.

## Honeybee Population Dynamics
- We developed a system of differential equations to model honeybee populations where the impact of the *varroa destructor* mite was of key importance.
- This was my undergraduate Honors Thesis at the University of South Dakota.
- I worked with [Dr. Dan Van Peursem](https://www.usd.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-and-staff/dan-vanpeursem) who is a hobby beekeeper and helped spark an interest in bees.
