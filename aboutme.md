I am a graduate student studying Statistics at Colorado State University, in the fourth year of my Ph.D. program. My research focuses on spatial statistics with nonparametric Bayesian methods. Outside of research, I enjoy teaching introductory courses and consulting. I have a M.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics from South Dakota State University.
