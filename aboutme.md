I am a graduate student in the Statistics Department at Colorado State University, in the fifth year of my Ph.D. program. My research focuses on spatial statistics using nonparametric Bayesian methods. Outside of research, I enjoy working with students in introductory courses and consulting. 

I graduated from South Dakota State University in 2021 with a M.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics.
